   2015 Aug  8 - Start porting from Angelia, 2 Receivers.
               - set PHY Rx_clock delay to 60.  Works!
               - test ICMP, changed Rx on posedge, works initally but fails after starting KK.
             9 - flash LED10 if icmp_rx_enable active.  Only active when icmp data valid.
               - Alex data not been seen.  
               - Saved as today's date.
               - Move Alex data flag to correct location.  .a_data_rdy(Alex_ready)
            10 - Added CW Break-in control.  Inhibit FPGA_PTT and RF generation if break_in not active.
               - Saved as today's date.
            12 - Closed timing except minimum pulse width.
               - Saved as today's date.
        Sep  4 - Imported changes from Angelia code.
               - Saved as today's date.
               - include High_Priority_CC from Angelia code. 
               - Prevent Quartus merging PLLs so that VCXO phase locks to 10MHz correctly. Set Auto Merge PLLs off. 
               - Corrected clock source for Alex data.
             5 - Added Alex code from Angelia.
               - saved as today's date.
               - redo timing
               - saved as today's date.   
             7 - Released to VK0S to test new programmer code.
            12 - Updated from Angelia code i.e. 10MHz PLL locked to C&C data, 
                 Set protocol version to 1.6.  24,980 LEs.
               - Saved as today's date.
            13 - Redo timing. No Rxs
               - NR = 1.
            16 - Padded sdr_send.v so that Discovery, erase and program replies are the same length.
            19 - Using receiver3.v and NR = 3, 89% full. Works but can't set individual sample rates
               - Redo timing. NR = 3 not reliable.
               - NR = 2, receiver2.v  
               - need to redo timing.
               - CURRENT CODE uses 2 Rx with receiver2.v 
            26 - Working on erase code to see why it sometimes does not respond 
               - (EPCS_state) now on posedge of clock.
               - connect ASMI busy and (erase | erase_done) to DEBUG_LEDs  - seems to be more reliable.
               - ASMI_interface was using negedge - change to posedge - erase done is faster?
            27 - Connect busy from ASMI_interface to .erase_ACK input on sdr_receive.v.  Since 
                 in different clock domains erase signal will remain active until ASMI_interface starts erasing EEPROM. 
               - Erase now works every time.
               - Saved as today's date.
            30 - Added Mux for Rx0 and Rx1 for PureSignal use. 
               - Saved as today's date.
      Oct   16 - Moved ASMI_interface back to negedge as per Angelia 
               - Saved as today's date.
      Dec   10 - Start porting latest code from 10E and Angelia 
               - Fix PTT latch issue.
               - Fix Discovery length 60 not 72 bytes.
               - Protocol version = 2.3
               - Fix Discovery to IP address
               - Fix Rx gain
               - Move Open Collector Outputs
               - Only send Exciter, FWD & REV power when Tx active.
               - DAC feedback when ADC = 1.
               - OK - saved as today's date
            11 - Added HW timeout
               - OK - saved as today's date.
            14 - Added 16 bit DAC support from Angelia 
               - OK - saved as today's date and released for testing.
            16 - Added send Discovery to network mask address. 
               - OK - saved as today's date and released for testing. 
            19 - Set Tune and CW levels equal.  New profile.mif table, added 'raised cosine profile.xls' to files 
                 Attenuate sidetone level due to new profile, see line 906
                 Use Angelia CicInterpM5.v to remove DC component from Tx output.
               - OK - saved as today's date and released for testing.
            20 - Fixed mic and wideband - swapped bytes
               - Saved as today's date and released.
   2016 Jan 17 - Added Tx_IQ_fifo almost_full, almost_empty.
               - Clear TR relay and Open Collectors if run not active.
               - Saved as today's date and released.
            27 - Feedback from Scotty, WA2DFI
               - Assigned DEBUG_LED1 to pin 9 - was missing its assignment.
               - Set PHY_TX_CLOCK to Max current to increase speed.
               - Removed reference to Mercury in Hermes.qsf file. 
               - Fixed mixed blocking and non blocking errors vis:
                  Rx_fifo_ctrl0.v line 89 (test)
                  receiver3.v lines 74 - 79 (rate0)
                  sdr_send.v lines 135, 139, 143 
                  profile.v line 102
                  receiver2.v lines 70 - 75  (rate0)
                  Hermes.v line 278 (instead of using the C construct, it should read 
                  "sec_count <= sec_count + 28'd1;"   Valid in SystemVerilog?
               - Added I05 amplifier tune input. 
            28 - Added IO4 input for Tx inhibit and user analogue input 1 for external PA protection.
               - Modify hardware time out to sec_count >= 28'd250...
               - Saved as today's date and released for testing.
            29 - More feedback from Scotty. WA2DFI
               - Removed use of x++ (since is blocking) at line 295 and in sdr_send.v lines 172, 182, 192 and 202 
               - Removed error messages relating to Data[1]/ASDO, FLASH_nCE/nCSO, DCLK and Data[0] pins by setting them to "Use as regular I/O".
               - Inhibit RF output if IO4 is low. 
               - Fixed sequence number error in srd_send.v,  bits [31:24] of sequence numbers not being sent. 
               - Saved as today's date and released for testing. 
       Feb  20 - Added hardware timer enable/disable
            21 - Use Byte 1363 for PureSignal Mux operation - see Rx_specific_CC.
               - Added new FIR code from Angelia.
       May   1 - Changed Hermes.sdc to use PHY_TX[*] rather than PHY_TX* in order to remove clocks.
       Aug  14 - Changed protocol version to V2.9
               - Released to Beta testers.
       Sep  24 - Use short packets for Mic and Rx Audio.
               - Interleave WB data with DDC data.
               - Rx 2 baseline jumps at 1.5Msps, set PHY_TX_CLOCK to Global
               - Saved as today's date.
               
2017  Mar    2 - Merged changes from Angelia V10.9. i.e. dhcp.v, network.v, ip_recv.v, icmp.v, icmp_fifo.v to fix DHCP issues. 
               - Add assign IF_rst = network_state since just one bit now. 
               - added an additional bit to the following FIFOs usedw port so that they don't appear empty when actually full: 
                 EPCS_fifo (increased used word sizes to [10:0]EPCS_Rx_used, [10:0]EPCS_wrused) NOTE: need to increase register in ASMI_interface.v
                 Rx_fifo (increased used word sizes to [11:0] Rx_used[0:NR-1])
                 Tx1_IQ_fifo (increased used word size to [12:0]write_used)
               - PS works but only if both receiver sample rates are set the same. Possible Thetis issue?
            3  - Saved as today's date and released for testing.

      Apr 26   - replaced dhcp.v, network.v, ip_recv.v, icmp.lv, icmp_fifo.v with versions from Angelia_Protocol_2_v11.6
               - replaced Alex SPI module, SPI.v, with version from Angelia_Protocol_2_v11.6 to send Alex data word twice each time 
                  the data word changes
               - changed CC_data declaration to [7:0] CC_data[0:55]
               - removed user_analog declaration and replaced with 
                  wire [15:0] user_analog1 = {4'b0, AIN4};
                  wire [15:0] user_analog2 = {4'b0, AIN3};
               - implemented peak detection for AIN1 and AIN2 as follows:
                        -created userADC_clk, 30.72MHz clock for Hermes_ADC.v which provides a 7.68MHz clock to 
                           the ADC78H90 chip, increasing its previous sampling rate x10
                        -replaced Hermes_ADC.v with version from Angelia_Protocol_2_v11.6 firmware
                        - replaced CC_encoder.v with version from Angelia_Protocol_2_v11.6
                        - replaced Ethernet/sdr_send.v with version from Angelia_Protocol_2_v11.6
                        -added pk_detect_reset and pk_detect_ack to Hermes.v
               - added user_analog1 and user_analog2 (deleted user_analog) to Hermes.v
               - added generated_clock constraint for userADC_clk (30.72 MHz) to Hermes.sdc
               - changed FW version number to v10.3
               - removed all max/min delay constraints from Hermes.sdc
               - retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed, released            
               
      Apr 27   - forced "Allow 1GB" (1000T) feature, i.e.,. set MODE2 = 1'b1
               - replaced Rx_fifo_ctrl0.v, Mux_clear.v, and added cdc_mcp #(8) SyncRx_inst with versions from Angelia_Protocol_2_v11.6
               - regenerated Rx_fifo and Tx1_IQ megafunctions adding an extra bit in the "word used" parameter
               - increased sizes by 1 bit for these declarations: 
                  wire [11:0] Rx_used[0:NR-1];
                  wire [12:0] write_used;                   
               - added fifo_clear and convert_state declarations to Hermes.v
               - changed PHY Rx clock skew setting to values[6] <= 16'h90FF in phy_cfg.v
               - changed version number to v10.4
               - removed all max/min delay constraints from Hermes.sdc
               - retimed/compiled iteratively until timing closed             
            
2019  Mar 30 - (N1GP) Worked with Chris/W2PA and Doug/W5WC on an issue with FPGA_PTT
            coming in late and cutting off the beginning of the CW_char.
            Or'd FPGA_PTT with Alex_data[27] assigned to runsafe_Alex_data,
            QSK much improved.
          - Added latching of data in initial states of SPI, TLV320_SPI, and Attenuator
          - Added _122_90 to the ADC timing
          - Changed FW version number to v10.6

2019  Apr 15 - (N1GP) Fixed Mic Boost (and other) issues in TLV320_SPI
          - Changed FW version number to v10.7
               
               
               You can get rid of the annoying critical warnings on the Data[1]/ASDO, FLASH_nCE/nCSO, DCLK and Data[0] pins by going into the <Device and Pin Options> 
               dialog (under <Assignments><Device>) and changing those four pins to "Use as regular I/O".
               Cyclone II devices required them to be set here, but in Cyclone III and later, they are used directly by the ASMI module.
